# Privacy Policy
**Last updated:** September 16, 2025

Cruza (“the App”) is operated by **Decanus Ltd** (“we”, “us”). We collect only what we need to power ride tracking, stats, discovery, and optional premium features.

## Information We Collect
- **Account data:** email, display name, identifiers from Apple Sign-In or other auth providers.
- **Ride data:** GPS samples, timestamps, device model/OS, derived metrics (distance, speed).
- **Optional media:** photos you upload.
- **Purchase data:** subscription status and in-app purchase receipts (tokens). *We never receive full payment card details.*
- **Diagnostics:** crash logs and performance metrics.

## How We Use Information
- Provide and improve the App (tracking, stats, maps, stolen-bike features).
- Sync purchases and entitlements (hide ads, unlock Pro features).
- Prevent fraud and abuse.
- Comply with legal obligations.

## Sharing
We **do not sell** your data. We share only with service providers (e.g., Firebase/Firestore/Storage, Apple IAP, analytics/crash reporting) under data-processing terms. We may disclose information if required by law.

## Data Retention
Account and ride data are kept while your account is active. You may delete your account in-app. Some records (e.g., purchase logs) may be retained as required by law.

## Your Rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, export, or delete your data. Contact us to exercise these rights.

## Children
Cruza is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your country).

## International Transfers
We may process data in the UK, EU, and other countries. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards.
